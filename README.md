<h1>MyFramework</h1>
<p>I've been working on a game this week, it's not completely finished yet, but the point is that I'm dragging a framework laptop with my mouse at the bottom, which doesn't look like it yet, but it should grab the framework components.
I used HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
<p>I used a little AI because I was really tired, but I'll do better next week.</p>
